# Dialect Support

This rule has not yet been added.
For now, we have only added some files and sources.
This section will gradually be expanded as the rule is written.

The files inside `original_files` were added from the v1 branch of the original repository, [`en-wl/wordlist`](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/tree/v1).
The newer, v2 branch, doesn't include the [varcon folder](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/tree/v1/varcon).
